            <h2>Messing With Windows 9x's Memory</h2>
            <h4>April 25, 2023</h4>

            <div id="cbreaker"><img src="images/cbreaker.png" /></div>

            <p>
                I recently discovered a few weeks ago
                just how bad the memory protection in Windows 9X actually was. For context, most modern
                operating systems have some kind of virtualization features to ensure that if a program running
                crashes or runs dangerous code, it can only mess up the memory that is allocated to the program
                without damaging any other running programs, or the operating system. I booted up a virtual
                machine with a copy of Windows 98, and wrote this C code. In a nutshell, this code, in an
                infinite for loop declares a char pointer at the memory address 0x00010000, sets the value at
                that address to 0 (so it just deletes whatever was stored at that address), and increments the
                pointer to the next byte. Normally, any modern operating system would simply give you a
                segmentation fault error, but not Windows 9X. Running this code on Windows 98 inside VMware
                gives me mixed results. Sometimes, the screen just goes black. Other times, I get an error like
                this, perfectly describing what just happened:</p>

            <p>It's actually kind of fun to mess with what the value at
                the pointer is being set to, because instead of replacing everything with 0, here are the
                results on the screen when you replace everything with 0xFFFFFFFF, the screen turns white instead! </p>

            <h2>Dial-up Internet in 2023?</h2>
            <h4>April 13, 2023</h4>
            <p>
                Can Dial-up internet still exist in 2023? Apparently, the answer is yes. Last summer I managed to
                get my Dell Dimension e510, with the help of a VOIP box, to accept incoming connections through its
                dial-up modem and actually provide an internet connection through it! Now, why would you want to
                do this in 2023? Dial-up internet is basically useless with the internet of today. But if you're
                into vintage computing like me, there are several reasons why it can be interesting to set something
                like this up yourself.

                    File Transfers: When trying to transfer data between old and new computers, it can be a pain
                    to have to split a file up, and swap floppy disks every 3-4 minutes. Using the modem instead
                    may still be slow, but this at least allows for the process of copying files to be more automated.

                    Vintage Web Browsing: If you load archived web sites from the Internet Archive, you can simulate
                    what it actually was like to use the internet on a dial-up connection back when they were more
                    common.
