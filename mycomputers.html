                This is probably my favorite vintage computer. The reason being that this model is actually the same
                model
                computer that I had growing up as a little kid until about 2010. Basically around late 1999 my father
                purchased this as the first family computer that both of my older siblings used throughout the early
                2000s
                until we acquired the Dell Dimension e510. After that, during my early childhood this was basically my
                main
                computer that I was able to use until 2010, it was probably the first computer I ever used. In 2010, my
                dad
                traded the original Gateway computer for an HP Windows 7 computer, and ever since I have wanted to get
                this
                exact Gateway model back, and on the 27th of April last year, I finally did. This might not be the exact
                model that my family originally had, but it was shipped with the same operating system, Windows 98SE,
                and
                looks completely identical to the original one we owned. The processor speed might have been different
                though. Here are the specs of my Gateway:

                <br>
                <br>
                CPU: Intel Celeron 400MHz Processor
                <br>
                Memory: 128MB SDram (originally 64MB)
                <br>
                Storage: 16GB SD card (see below)
                <br>
                Removable Media: 3.5” Floppy Drive, CD-ROM Drive
                <br>
                Operating System: Windows 98SE (currently, see below)
                <br>
                <br>

                When I purchased this computer, it came with no hard drive, so I had to get one on my own. I was
                originally
                considering just putting a normal 10-20GB hard drive into the computer, but then I found out it was
                possible
                to use a converter that allows you to use an SD card instead of a traditional hard drive. This gives
                me several benefits, mainly that I can try several different operating systems on this computer at the
                same
                time while not having to completely re-install every operating system when I want to switch back. This
                also
                allows me to be able to insert the SD cards into my modern computer and easily manage the files that are
                on the
                Gateway without having to write them to floppy disks, burn them to CD's, email them, etc. It lets me
                easily
                get files off of and onto my Gateway.

                This is my second favorite ‘vintage’ computer, although I find it harder to call it vintage since it was
                manufactured in 2004. I acquired this from a family member back in November 2019. I really love these
                old
                Dell Dimensions from this era. This computer was shipped with Windows XP Home SP1. Here are the specs:

                <br>
                <br>
                Processor: Intel Pentium 4, 2.6GHZ, Single Core
                <br>
                Memory: 2GB DDR1 (originally 256MB)
                <br>
                Hard Drive: 80GB IDE
                <br>
                Removable Media: 3.5” Floppy, CD-ROM drive (floppy custom added)
                <br>
                Expansion cards: 56k Modem
                <br>
                Operating System: Windows XP
                <br>
                <br>

                For a little while I actually dualbooted Windows XP with Windows 98, and it worked well while the system
                was
                only running on 256MB of RAM. I had to replace the RAM because it began to cause many freezes and blue
                screens in Windows XP, I supposed the RAM was not reading/writing correctly anymore, and a run of
                MemTest86
                proved it. So I decided to max out the ram to 2GB, the most the motherboard in this computer could
                support.
                It definitely runs much better, although I had to remove my Windows 98 partition since Windows 98
                generally
                struggles to run with more than 1GB of RAM.

                This was the computer that my family primarily used between 2005-2010. It is a Windows XP computer which
                shipped with the Media Center edition, which added the Windows Media Center for Windows XP along with a
                few
                extra desktop themes. I currently have the original CD drive removed since I am using it in a different
                computer.
                Here are the specs:

                <br>
                <br>
                Processor: Intel Pentium 4, 3GHz, Single core
