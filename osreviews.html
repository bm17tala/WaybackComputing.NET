            <p>When you use Windows 3.1, you can really appreciate why Windows 95 was such a big deal. For it’s time,
                Windows 3.1 isn’t really a bad operating system –
                but can it really be called that? To install Windows
                3.1, you already had to have MS-DOS installed on your computer. MS-DOS was your operating system, not
                Windows 3.1. Windows 3.1 simply ran on top of MS-DOS. When you start Windows 3.1, the operating system
                would have a forever-open Program Manager which contained folders that consisted of all the Windows
                programs installed to your computer.
                There was no taskbar, shortcuts did not exist, the only desktop
                icons you could have were when you minimized running programs – so in essence the desktop became what we
                think of as the taskbar nowadays. Imagine however if you had Microsoft Word open and maximized while you
                had music playing in another program – since there was no taskbar, you had to minimize Word, and then
                open your media player to change anything about the music you were playing. There are just small, simple
                things like that which really make you appreciate the features that Windows 95 added. This isn’t to say
                that Windows 3.1 was a bad operating system – but it had many issues which Windows 95 would come in and fix.

                A true classic. It not only added loads of features to Windows that we take for granted nowadays, but it
                was the first version of Windows to actually be it’s own stand-alone operating system. Prior to Windows

                95, Windows was a GUI that ran on-top of an already existing MS-DOS installation. Windows 95 is really
                where Windows as we know it today began to take shape – it was the first version of Windows to include
                the Start menu, fixing the always-open program manager from Windows 3.1 and refining it into a menu that
                opens from the taskbar – also a new feature. The taskbar make multitasking far easier as well since
                programs could easily be switched between at just the click of the button, it was the first version of
                Windows to list all the running programs on the taskbar. On top of this, getting on the internet at the
                time was made far, far easier with Windows 95 since the operating system came with the first version of
                Internet Explorer and TCP/IP software ready to be installed with a simple wizard. In a few years,
                Microsoft would attempt to build on the success of making the internet easier to use in Windows 95 and
                further integrate the internet into Windows with Windows 98.

                It’s definitely one of my favorite vintage releases of Windows. I’ve actually seen some people give
                Windows 98 more hate because it was the first Windows version to include the Active Desktop feature,

                which allowed users to put internet links and web pages on their desktops, but some people found the
                feature to be broken and glitchy. That was the aim of Microsoft in this version, to capitalize on the
                growing internet at the time by highly integrating internet features into the operating system. It was
                also the first version of Windows to have Windows Update.

                I’d consider this ‘Windows XP Lite.’ In a lot of ways, Windows 2000 in my opinion is just a trimmed down
                version of what would become Windows XP a year later. It’s basically just Windows XP but with the

                9x-like versions of Windows Explorer, the start menu, and of course doesn’t have the blue and green
                theme of XP.

                The most infamously hated Windows version, aside from Vista. Overall though coming at it from a 2020’s
                perspective, I think most people hated ME because they were expecting something different in ME from

                what they actually got. Many people may have confused ME with Windows 2000, so they might have been
                excepting a more stable operating system than what they were used to with Windows 95/98 – when the
                opposite was the case. Windows ME was the last Windows version to be based off of the 9x kernel, which
                may have been ME’s biggest downfall. The 9x kernel was already somewhat unstable in Windows 95 and 98,
                but that could at least at the time have been excused by the plethora of new features that were
                introduced in those versions of Windows, especially 95. Whereas ME not only ran on top of the old 9x/DOS
                kernel, but went further to remove the old MS-DOS capabilities of 95/98. For context, one of the big
                worries of Windows 3.1 users was that their old MS-DOS programs would not work if they upgraded to
                Windows 95. In response, Microsoft made an ‘MS-DOS mode’ that the user could restart in, which would
                temporarily remove the Windows 95 shell and just give the user a DOS prompt, from which they could run
                most pre-existing DOS software. Windows ME completely removed this for basically no reason despite still
                technically being built on the old MS-DOS kernel. Windows ME did have several new features that would
                catch on later in the 2000s such as featuring the first version of Windows Movie Maker, and giving the
                user the ability to create system restore points to recover their computer in case something went
                seriously wrong with the operating system. But unfortunately people weren’t able to focus on those new
                features until they were ported over to Windows XP because of Windows ME’s problems. Overall, people
                were expecting much more out of Windows ME but were let down, leading to ME’s infamously bad reputation.

                This has to be one of my favorite Windows releases. It was the first consumer Windows version that
                utilized
                the NT kernel, putting the DOS kernel used in Windows 9x era to a close and thereby heavily increasing
                the
                stability the Windows operating system for consumers. Aside from the under-the-hood work, this version
                of
                Windows was the biggest innovation of the Windows user interface since Windows 95. It introduced a more
                colorful blue and green interface, and a completely reinvented start menu. It was the first Windows
                version
                to include the Welcome screen, which allowed users to choose between several different user accounts
                easily
                upon starting the computer instead of having to manually type in their username to sign in. The Welcome
                Screen also introduced the ability to switch users, which allowed one user to keep whatever programs
                they
                had open while someone else could log in to their account. It also packaged some of the good parts of
                Windows ME, such as Windows Movie Maker and the ability to create system restore points. Because of its
                simplicity, Windows XP would become the most widely used consumer operating systems in the 2000s, and
                had an
                unusually long lifespan, usually Microsoft ends extended support for their operating systems around 8-10
                years after release, whereas Windows XP was supported from its release in October 2001 until April 8th,
                2014!

            <p>
                Windows Vista had a messy development stage known as 'Longhorn', because Microsoft wavered a lot about
                what features they
                wanted
                this version of Windows to have. So when it finally released over 5 years after Windows XP, it was just
                too
                advanced for the average hardware people had at the time which is why it received so much hate. The main
                features of Windows Vista over Windows XP was meant to be the introduction of User Account Control,
                which
                would make the computer prompt to run a program as an administrator if it required administrative
                privileges. This was intended to add extra security to the Windows operating system, but instead people
                found that it would just cause the user to get annoying popups way more often than Windows XP when
                trying to
                install programs, and in some cases, when just trying to run programs. The other big feature was the
                introduction of the Windows Aero theme, which added a 3D, glass-like theme to the Windows interface. The
                theme was later reworked in Windows 7 and looked decent even in Windows Vista, but being that this
                operating
                system was released in 2007, most people’s computers could just not handle the transparency effects of
                the
                theme yet. Many people were let down when they upgraded to Windows Vista on their computers, only to
                find
                out that their computers would outright not run the Aero theme entirely. On top of that, people often
                reported their computer just running slower compared to how they ran on XP. If anything, Vista ended up
                contributing to an increased lifespan for Windows XP, and taught Microsoft some valuable lessons which
                they
                ended up working around to make Windows 7.

                Windows 7 honestly has to be one of my favorite, if not my absolute favorite Windows version for when it
                was
                supported. It fixed the many problems that people encountered with Windows Vista. One of the big
                advantages
                for Microsoft was that when Windows 7 was released in 2009, it allowed some time for the hardware most
                people had to catch up to what Windows Vista and 7 demanded from computers. Therefore, since Windows 7
                didn’t have such a major jump in terms of what it demanded from hardware compared to what its
                predecessor
                did, it was received far better by consumers than Vista. Windows 7 slightly redesigned the Windows Aero
                theme slightly, and by 2009 more people were used to the Aero theme and able to use it. Also, the User
                Account Control feature was altered to prompt the user less often, making the feature less annoying to
                users. Aside from these fixes, Windows 7 added some new features such as being able to pin programs to
                the
                task bar, which has been in every Windows version since. Overall, Windows 7 was a much needed fix to the
                many problems that people had with Windows Vista, and was used well into the 2010s, and actually used by
                me
                personally until 2019.

            <p>
                This is going to be an unpopular opinion – I actually kind of liked Windows 8. Although I’ll say that
                the
                Windows 8.1 update was a little better than the original Windows 8. The main issue people had with
                Windows 8
                was Microsoft’s attempt to turn Windows 8 into more of a tablet-oriented operating system. In the
                original
                Windows 8 release from 2012, this meant the removal of the traditional start menu and it being replaced
                with
                a Start Screen instead, with large boxes to open each app installed to your computer. Windows 8 actually
                makes a lot of sense if it is used on a tablet. The gestures are easier to learn and the interface
                overall
                visually looks better when used on a tablet or touchscreen. The problem was that Microsoft intended for
                Windows 8 to be used on average desktop PCs. This is why Windows 8 was received badly – people found it
                upsetting to have the old-fashioned Start menu completely removed from the operating system, completely
                replaced by the start screen. People also found it awkward to try to use the same gestures used on
                tablets
                with their mouse on desktop PC’s to do basic things such as opening the ‘charms’ menu which would allow
                you
                to shut down your computer, or to close an application by sliding down from the top, which by using a
                mouse
                would mean you had to click and drag from the top of the screen, down to the bottom to close an app. In
                2013, Microsoft released a patch to Windows 8, which was Windows 8.1. This new version of Windows 8
                fixed
                some of the problems desktop users had with Windows 8, namely by allowing users to see the desktop upon
                startup, and also showing the start menu icon on the desktop again since that was removed in the
                original
                release of Windows 8. The update was a step in the right direction, but still had many issues for
                desktop
                users which Microsoft went on to address in Windows 10.

            <p>
                Windows 10 fixed a lot of the GUI problems that people encountered with Windows 8. The problems people
                experienced with Windows 8 were mainly desktop users that were forced to use an interface mainly
                designed
                for a tablet. Microsoft fixed this in Windows 10 by adding a tablet mode switch - users could now
                manually
                switch between whether they wanted an interface more geared towards desktops or tablets, making both
                kinds of PC users satisfied. The tablet mode kept the start screen from Windows 8, whereas the desktop
                mode brought back the Start Menu. Windows 10 was also the first version of Windows to include a
                web-search
                feature built into the taskbar, and Microsoft's personal assistant, Cortana. I can see why people might
                like
                the web search feature, but personally if I need to search something on the internet, I'll open a web
                browser
                for that, it's annoying to see a bunch of web results appear in my taskbar when I'm just trying to
                search
                for a program installed to my computer. Aside from those new features, there are in my opinion some big
                problems with Windows 10. It introduced a lot of features to Windows that I just don't
                like which unfortunately have stuck around into Windows 11. First, the forced Windows updates. Back in
                2015, it was actually kind of a meme where there would be a bunch of video game streamers online getting
                kicked offline because their computers decided to automatically restart to perform Windows Updates while
                they were playing a game. Jokes aside though, Windows Updates in Windows 10 went from something that
                used
                to be optional in Windows 8 and prior, there was an explicit setting in the older Windows versions to
                turn
                it off within Control Panel, to something that you're basically forced to have run on your computer
                unless
                you manually go into your system services and turn the Windows Update service off from there. It's an
                extra
                step Microsoft has added that just doesn't need to be there, so they can force more users who don't have
                the
                know-how to turn Windows Update off this way to get Windows Updates they don't want installed. I
                understand
                that system updates are important to the security of a computer, especially Windows where there is more
                malware written for it than any other platform, but still, the user should be able to make a clear, easy
                choice about what goes on with their computer. Another thing I really didn't like was the Microsoft
                account syncing. Starting in Windows 10, if you connected to the internet during the OOBE
                (Out of Box Experience), Windows would force you to either link a Microsoft account to your user
                account,
                or make a Microsoft account if you didn't have one. Once again, if you have the know-how, you can get
                around this. But even people with the know-how might make the mistake of just connecting their computer
                to the internet during setup, and then have to use a Microsoft account. Overall, Windows 10 was the
                beginning
                of when Microsoft has silently promoted this idea that they basically get to control what goes on with
                your
                computer, and not you, the consumer. It's why on my CyberPowerPC, after moving from Windows 8 to Windows
                7 because of the differences in the GUI, I stuck with Windows 7 all the way until the end of 2019, just
                before
                the end of support date for Windows 7. Because Windows 7 kept things simple and easily in my control.

                I haven’t used it too much to give a definitive opinion over it, but honestly I don’t like it as much as
                Windows 10. It basically has the problems I mention about Windows 10, along with some GUI changes that
                just
                don't make sense. The one big change I realized is how Windows no longer lets you drag icons from your
                desktop
                and easily pin them to your taskbar. Here, I really can't see a motive as to why Microsoft thought this
                was
                a good idea. It's just a feature that has been around since Windows 7, (Windows 98 if you want to count
                in
                Quick Launch), that they removed for no reason. You can still pin items to the taskbar, but dragging
                icons
                in this specific fashion no longer works and I'm not sure why they thought that was a good idea to
                remove
                that functionality. I actually do like the new Start menu a little more than
                Windows 10, it is nice to be able to easily pin all your programs as proper icons to your start menu so
                you
                can easily start your most commonly used programs. This version of Windows ultimately removed the
                desktop/tablet switch feature of Windows 10 and tried to blend them together in Windows 11, although I'd
                say the interface leans more towards a desktop-friendly interface than a tablet-friendly interface.

                This was my first Linux distribution that I ever tried and installed on my computer, as it is for many
                other people. Personally, I do like the Ubuntu/Debian branch of Linux. Personally I’ve found more stuff
                to just be compatible with Ubuntu or Debian based Linux systems. As for Ubuntu, the distribution in
                particular, I’m not to fond of the Gnome desktop that is default. I understand that you can install
                different desktop environments on Linux, but I’m going to review this because it is the default
                environment in vanilla Ubuntu. This might be coming from my internal bias towards Windows over Mac OS,
                but there’s little features that just bug me in Gnome. First, the applications menu. It takes up the
                whole screen. They seemed to get this right nearly 30 years ago in Windows 95, they put all your
                applications, settings, everything you would need right into a small corner of the screen. But instead
                Gnome fills your entire screen with giant application icons and a search bar. I find it annoying because
                it covers anything that you have open. Second is moving files within the GUI. I’ve found that often,
                dragging and dropping files between explorer windows, or dragging files from an explorer window to the
                desktop and vice versa just don’t work. The feature is just not part of the desktop. Now, it’s not too
                big of a deal to just simply select all the items I want to move, press cut, then paste them in their
                destination – but I should just be able to drag and drop everything. It’s a feature that you know should
                be in the desktop but is not.

                This is probably one of my favorite Ubuntu based distributions. It has the underlying workings of
                vanilla Ubuntu that makes it great, but it does away with Gnome and comes with your choice of either
                Cinnamon, Mate or XFCE desktop – the Linux Mint team provides three different ISO files with one of
                those desktop environments pre-loaded into each ISO file. I personally really like Cinnamon desktop –
                once again, it might be my internal Windows bias that makes me favor Mint over vanilla Ubuntu, but it’s
                really nice to run a Linux distro running Ubuntu, making it compatible with everything that runs on
                Ubuntu, but also having a desktop environment I’ve been familiar with since I was a kid.

            <p>
                I really like Arch Linux actually. It takes a bit of learning to use it, and can really give you a much
                better understanding of how a Linux system actually works far better than if you install a different Linux distro,
                so it’s definitely not for beginners. There is no GUI in the modern sense that lets you install the
                operating system. There is the archinstall program that comes on the ISO, but even then, it still runs
                on the command line interface. To install vanilla Arch Linux, you have to manually partition/format your
                drive, download and install all of your packages, and configure them all by yourself through the command
                line. There’s definitely
                much more time involved in getting it to work, but once you do, it’s a really great operating system.
                You can basically make whatever you want of it. You can choose to install any desktop environment you
                want, or lack thereof if your needs only require the raw terminal. There are no annoying, pre-installed
                packages that you’re never going to use, since you have to install all your packages yourself. If it
                weren’t for some of the compatibility issues that it has, namely that some Linux programs only work on
                the more common distributions like Ubuntu, it would probably be my favorite Linux distribution, if not,
                my favorite operating system. It gives you total, full control over your computer to make whatever you
                want of it. My screenshot perfectly encompasses that - my Arch Linux install that I have looks a lot like
                the interface from Windows XP, however that is a desktop enviroment and theme that I configured myself, 
                and it is possible to choose almost any user interface that you want!
